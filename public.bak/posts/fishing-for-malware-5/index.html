My original intention was to aim for a total of one million logged attacks, at which point I would shut down the honeypot. However, schoolwork fully occupied my attention for a brief period. Thus, I considered it a better idea to continue collecting data until I could find time to perform a proper analysis. That time is now, and instead of blocking traffic upon “only” the millionth attack, the Elastic dashboard looks like this:\nThe million-attack target was surpassed by a significant margin. But, without further ado, let’s examine the results.\nPreliminary Information All bait services were exposed to the Internet on 19 January 2022 at 3:00 PM PST. I restricted all traffic on my VPC to my IP address on 09 February 2022 at 6:00 PM PST. Thus, services were exposed for external attack for 21 days and 3 hours.\nIn that time, over 1,566,300 attacks were recorded by the following honeypots:\n Adbhoney Ciscoasa Citrixhoneypot Conpot Cowrie Ddospot Dicompot Dionaea Elasticpot Endlessh Glutton Heralding Hellpot Honeypots Honeypy Honeysap Honeytrap Ipphoney Log4pot Mailoney Medpot Rdpy Redishoneypot Snare Tanner  Setup was automated by Telekom’s T-POT. Since Dionaea (757,121), Heralding (418,182), Honeytrap (294,052), Cowrie (71,204), Adbhoney (12,440), Rdpy (5,567), and Tanner (4,093) logged the vast majority of the attacks, I will maintain focus on them for the most part.\nThe honeypot was hosted for the duration of its uptime on a Google Cloud instance in The Dalles, Oregon on us-west1. The host OS was Debian 10 and firewall rules permitted ports UDP and TCP 1 to 64000 ingress access from any IP address. This honeypot was not intended to appear as a legitimate target for hackers to manually compromise, but rather a target for malicious bots. As could be seen on Shodan (screenshot below), the host was undisputably a honeypot. Tip: click or tap the image to zoom in.\nNo legitimate host would have that many open ports, and if so… Well, respectfully, the sysadmin in charge should consider re-evaluating their security policy.\nAll binaries examined in previous sections of this series have been sourced from the honeypots executed here within the aforementioned timeframe.\nData Most Popular Attack Vectors By far, the most common type of attack was brute-forcing common credential sets against services that support login, especially SSH, VNC, RDP, and FTP; I suppose naive attacks are to be expected. Let’s take a look at which usernames and passwords were used. T-POT uses Elastic to generate useful word clouds of these points of data.\nUsernames Note that not all usernames are shown here. Download the full dataset here. The top five usernames attempted across all services were:\n root — 6,222 attempts sa — 711 attempts user — 546 attempts admin — 412 attempts test — 145 attempts  All of these, especially root, seem pretty reasonable to me.\nPasswords Note that, as with the usernames, not all passwords are shown here either. Download the full dataset here. The top five passwords attempted across all services were:\n Password — 600 attempts 123456 — 431 attempts 1 — 398 attempts empty/no password — 353 attempts Passw0rd — 292 attempts  Again, all quite reasonable. Here are some that are perhaps less than reasonable:\n raspberryraspberry993311 — 55 attempts; see this post for more information ^_^$$wanniMaBI:: 1433 vl — 40 attempts; what?  Always set unique, secure passwords! The bots that targeted my honeypot take advantage of those who want the convenience of only remembering 123456 as their password.\nOrigins of Attack Things get particularly interesting here — see the breakdown of attacks by country below. Note that even though an attack comes from an ASN located within certain borders, the attacker(s) may very well have routed their traffic in a complex manner to hide their identities. Thus, attacks that originate from the United States but route through Utrecht with a VPN will, of course, appear to be Dutch attacks instead.\nNumerical breakdown in terms of attacks by country:\n Netherlands: 415,771 United States: 205,221 India: 94,108 Vietnam: 89,762 Russia: 78,176 Mexico: 61,626 China: 55,720 Indonesia: 52,440 Brazil: 43,013 Turkey: 29,550  Damned Dutch and their… cyber criminals? I did not expect these results at all. A map of estimated attack origins is shown below, which can also be downloaded here.\nHere is more information:\nHere is a list of the most common attack origins by IP address:\n 185.232.52.40 — 395,126 attacks 193.169.254.17 — 21,041 attacks 159.89.48.65 — 13,889 attacks 189.84.186.154 — 12,810 attacks 103.103.175.121 — 11,046 attacks 202.88.237.202 — 11,043 attacks 200.23.18.185 — 11,042 attacks 103.151.218.73 — 11,041 attacks 163.53.180.248 — 11,041 attacks 175.111.4.204 — 11,039 attacks  Curiously, as of the time of publication, I appear to be one of the only reporters of 185.232.52.40 on VirusTotal; surprising, given the volume of attacks.\nAnd, finally, here is a list of the top ten attacks by the ASN the origin address belongs to:\n 200313 (“Internet It Company Inc”): 395,229 attacks 7552 (“Viettel Group”): 50,968 attacks 14061 (“DigitalOcean, LLC”): 27,776 attacks 8151 (“Uninet S.A. de C.V.\"): 26,367 attacks 7713 (“PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia”): 25,264 attacks 4134 (“No.31,Jin-rong Street”): 25,247 attacks 45899 (“VNPT Corp”): 22,694 attacks 197226 (“sprint S.A.\"): 21,055 attacks 8048 (“CANTV Servicios, Venezuela”): 19,010 attacks 8452 (“TE-AS”): 16,526 attacks  Attacks I have included several charts below. Patterns can easily be seen, especially relating to activity from the Netherlands.\nAttempted brute-force attacks towards port 5900 (VNC) by the Netherlands remain the most significant pattern overall in terms of scope — the Netherlands composed over one-third of all 1.5 million attacks on its own. Of particular note is the measurable spikes of activity during those attacks. In all, just under 400,000 attempts were made by what I assume is the same bot or group of bots routing traffic through the Netherlands.\nBrief Conclusions So, what can we learn here? The most significant point to me is that the vast majority of automated attacks that targeted me used naive methods. My findings here only serve to reinforce the idea that the most dangerous elements in computer security are us. Attackers here were not abusing zero-day flaws, nor using sophisticated methodologies.\nInstead, bots were used to perform mass reconnaissance, searching for low-hanging security fruit, namely default passwords. The attackers were looking for those of us who habitually neglect to employ comprehensive initial security configurations. Those of us who put off applying security patches for years (the most common exploit attempt by far was CVE-2006-2369). Those of us who leave all of our services exposed to the Internet at all times unnecessarily. Ransomware was deployed nearly 100 times, but it wasn’t novel technology; no, it was mainly WannaCry, patched by Microsoft in 2017.\nAs a security community, we can certainly do better. These attacks wouldn’t occur if they weren’t successful at times. Even the most basic security policy would mitigate the majority, if not all of the attacks I received. Let’s make sure we change our passwords, use firewalls — they exist for a reason — and patch our software to keep our environments safe.\nThanks so much for reading. Questions or comments? Please email me — I’d love to hear from you.\n ← Fishing for Malware: Part 4\nI am open to comments and criticism — I learn alongside you.

</p>
<p>The million-attack target was surpassed by a significant margin. But, without further ado, let&rsquo;s examine the results.</p>
<h2 id=preliminary-information>Preliminary Information<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preliminary-information>#</a></h2>
<p>All bait services were exposed to the Internet on 19 January 2022 at 3:00 PM PST. I restricted all traffic on my VPC to my IP address on 09 February 2022 at 6:00 PM PST. Thus, services were exposed for external attack for 21 days and 3 hours.</p>
<p>In that time, over 1,566,300 attacks were recorded by the following honeypots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adbhoney</li>
<li>Ciscoasa</li>
<li>Citrixhoneypot</li>
<li>Conpot</li>
<li>Cowrie</li>

<li>Medpot</li>
<li>Rdpy</li>
<li>Redishoneypot</li>
<li>Snare</li>
<li>Tanner</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup was automated by <a href=https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce>Telekom&rsquo;s T-POT</a>. Since Dionaea (757,121), Heralding (418,182), Honeytrap (294,052), Cowrie (71,204), Adbhoney (12,440), Rdpy (5,567), and Tanner (4,093) logged the vast majority of the attacks, I will maintain focus on them for the most part.</p>
<p>The honeypot was hosted for the duration of its uptime on a Google Cloud instance in The Dalles, Oregon on <code>us-west1</code>. The host OS was Debian 10 and firewall rules permitted ports UDP and TCP 1 to 64000 ingress access from any IP address. This honeypot was not intended to appear as a legitimate target for hackers to manually compromise, but rather a target for malicious bots. As could be seen on Shodan (screenshot below), the host was undisputably a honeypot. <em>Tip: click or tap the image to zoom in.</em></p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/media/fishing-for-malware-5-2.png alt="Screenshot of the Honeypot in Shodan">
</p>
<p>No legitimate host would have that many open ports, and if so&mldr; Well, respectfully, the sysadmin in charge should consider re-evaluating their security policy.</p>
<p>All binaries examined in previous sections of this series have been sourced from the honeypots executed here within the aforementioned timeframe.</p>

<p>By far, the most common type of attack was brute-forcing common credential sets against services that support login, especially SSH, VNC, RDP, and FTP; I suppose naive attacks are to be expected. Let&rsquo;s take a look at which usernames and passwords were used. T-POT uses Elastic to generate useful word clouds of these points of data.</p>

<p><img loading=lazy src=/media/fishing-for-malware-5-3.png alt="Screenshot of the Username Tagcloud">
</p>
<p>Note that not all usernames are shown here. Download the full dataset <a href=/files/fishing-for-malware-usernames.csv>here</a>. The top five usernames attempted across all services were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code> — 6,222 attempts</li>
<li><code>sa</code> — 711 attempts</li>
<li><code>user</code> — 546 attempts</li>
<li><code>admin</code> — 412 attempts</li>
<li><code>test</code> — 145 attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these, especially <code>root</code>, seem pretty reasonable to me.</p>
<h4 id=passwords>Passwords<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#passwords>#</a></h4>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/media/fishing-for-malware-5-4.png alt="Screenshot of the Password Tagcloud">
</p>
<p>Note that, as with the usernames, not all passwords are shown here either. Download the full dataset <a href=/files/fishing-for-malware-passwords.csv>here</a>. The top five passwords attempted across all services were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Password</code> — 600 attempts</li>

<li><code>1</code> — 398 attempts</li>
<li>empty/no password — 353 attempts</li>
<li><code>Passw0rd</code> — 292 attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, all quite reasonable. Here are some that are perhaps less than reasonable:</p>

<p><em>Damned Dutch and their&mldr; cyber criminals?</em> I did not expect these results at all. A map of estimated attack origins is shown below, which can also be downloaded <a href=/files/fishing-for-malware-worldmap.csv>here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the most common attack origins by IP address:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>185.232.52.40</code> — 395,126 attacks</li>
<li><code>193.169.254.17</code> — 21,041 attacks</li>
<li><code>159.89.48.65</code> — 13,889 attacks</li>
<li><code>189.84.186.154</code> — 12,810 attacks</li>
<li><code>103.103.175.121</code> — 11,046 attacks</li>
<li><code>202.88.237.202</code> — 11,043 attacks</li>
<li><code>200.23.18.185</code> — 11,042 attacks</li>
<li><code>103.151.218.73</code> — 11,041 attacks</li>
<li><code>163.53.180.248</code> — 11,041 attacks</li>
<li><code>175.111.4.204</code> — 11,039 attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiously, as of the time of publication, I appear to be one of the only reporters of <a href=https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/1a498ec3f03e4c6cb93057729da140a1eb237f35707a877a30742949521d0868/detection><code>185.232.52.40</code></a> on VirusTotal; surprising, given the volume of attacks.</p>
<p>And, finally, here is a list of the top ten attacks by the ASN the origin address belongs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>200313 (&ldquo;Internet It Company Inc&rdquo;): 395,229 attacks</li>
<li>7552 (&ldquo;Viettel Group&rdquo;): 50,968 attacks</li>
<li>14061 (&ldquo;DigitalOcean, LLC&rdquo;): 27,776 attacks</li>
<li>8151 (&ldquo;Uninet S.A. de C.V."): 26,367 attacks</li>
<li>7713 (&ldquo;PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia&rdquo;): 25,264 attacks</li>
<li>4134 (&ldquo;No.31,Jin-rong Street&rdquo;): 25,247 attacks</li>
<li>45899 (&ldquo;VNPT Corp&rdquo;): 22,694 attacks</li>
<li>197226 (&ldquo;sprint S.A."): 21,055 attacks</li>
<li>8048 (&ldquo;CANTV Servicios, Venezuela&rdquo;): 19,010 attacks</li>
<li>8452 (&ldquo;TE-AS&rdquo;): 16,526 attacks</li>

<p>I have included several charts below. Patterns can easily be seen, especially relating to activity from the Netherlands.</p>

</p>
<p>Attempted brute-force attacks towards port 5900 (VNC) by the Netherlands remain the most significant pattern overall in terms of scope — the Netherlands composed over one-third of all 1.5 million attacks on its own. Of particular note is the measurable spikes of activity during those attacks. In all, just under 400,000 attempts were made by what I assume is the same bot or group of bots routing traffic through the Netherlands.</p>
<h2 id=brief-conclusions>Brief Conclusions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#brief-conclusions>#</a></h2>
<p>So, what can we learn here? The most significant point to me is that <em>the vast majority of automated attacks that targeted me used naive methods.</em> My findings here only serve to reinforce the idea that the most dangerous elements in computer security are <em>us</em>. Attackers here were not abusing zero-day flaws, nor using sophisticated methodologies.</p>
<p>Instead, bots were used to perform mass reconnaissance, searching for low-hanging security fruit, namely default passwords. The attackers were looking for those of us who habitually neglect to employ comprehensive initial security configurations. Those of us who put off applying security patches for years (the most common exploit attempt by far was <a href=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-2369>CVE-2006-2369</a>). Those of us who leave all of our services exposed to the Internet at all times unnecessarily. Ransomware was deployed nearly 100 times, but it wasn&rsquo;t novel technology; no, it was mainly WannaCry, patched by Microsoft in 2017.</p>
<p>As a security community, we can certainly do better. These attacks wouldn&rsquo;t occur if they weren&rsquo;t successful at times. Even the most basic security policy would mitigate the majority, if not <em>all</em> of the attacks I received. Let&rsquo;s make sure we change our passwords, use firewalls — they exist for a reason — and patch our software to keep our environments safe.</p>
