Hey there! My name is Sid Lacy. I am a student at Western Washington University, double-majoring in cybersecurity and political science; I aspire to one day fill a role in my professional life that sees some intersection between the two. Currently, I also cohead and represent the [Western Washington University Cybersecurity Club](https://wwucyber.com) as a member of the Cybersecurity Department, working with my peers to spread awareness and discuss contemporary news related to cybersecurity, and to promote activity in security-related technical events.

In my free time, I write here, populating this site with posts on my [blog](/blog) and publishing articles in the [Documents section](/docs), both of which have a general emphasis on the study of computer security. My intention behind *swlacy.com* is two-sided: first, I use this space to enrich my knowledge, providing a more elegant, professional location to publish work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. Second, I aim for this space to be of equal use to others, to become a trove of information those interested in computer security can use to benefit from as well. Learning is for everyone — I appreciate your interest in my page, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.

Beyond security, I also enjoy hiking around the beautiful Pacific Northwest, staying up to date on international and domestic politics, and playing strategy games. While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment, regularly uploading new articles is a personal goal I have set for myself — if nothing interests you now, please revisit soon to see new submissions.

If you would like to reach out to me for any reason, you may easily do so via [email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com?subject=Hello!). I would love to hear from you. Further, if you want to speak with me professionally, perhaps would you also like to see my [resume (PDF)](/resume) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacysw/). The LaTeX source code is hosted on GitHub under [lacysw/resume](https://github.com/lacysw/resume/blob/main/resume.tex). Finally, the [Links section](/links) contains a comprehensive set of references to the remainder of my online services.

Thank you again for visiting!
