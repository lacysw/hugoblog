## Personal Background
Hello! My name is Sid Lacy [/sɪd ˈleɪsi/]. I am a student at Western Washington University, double-majoring in cybersecurity and political science; I aspire to one day fill a role in my professional life that sees some intersection between the two (hello, CISA?). Currently, I also cohead and represent the [Western Washington University Cybersecurity Club](https://wwucyber.com) as a member of the WWU Cybersecurity Department, working with my peers to spread awareness and discuss contemporary news related to cybersecurity, and promoting activity in security-related technical events.

In my free time, I write here, populating this site with posts on my [blog](/blog) and publishing articles in the [documents section](/docs), both of which have a general emphasis on the study of computer security. My intention behind *swlacy.com* is two-sided: first, I use this space to enrich my knowledge, providing a more elegant, professional location to publish work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. Second, I aim for this space to be of equal use to others, to eventually become a trove of information those interested in computer security can use to benefit from as well. I appreciate your interest in my site, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.

Beyond security, I enjoy hiking around the beautiful Pacific Northwest, which I am grateful to call home, staying up to date on international and domestic politics, and playing strategy games. While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment, regularly uploading new articles is a personal goal I have set for myself. If nothing interests you now, please revisit soon to see new submissions.

## Professional Qualifications

*"Who cares what you have to say on this site anyway?"*

Valid question — I appreciate skepticism and I do not claim to be a security expert by any means. Regardless, I believe that my academic experience and my (admittedly short) time in the IT/security industry are valuable and have provided me with the perspective needed to discuss topics related to security at large.

#### Experience
