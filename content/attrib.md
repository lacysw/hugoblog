I would neither be able to create nor maintain this website without the hard work of others. The following list documents the significant frameworks, code, and ideas that I used while designing *swlacy.com*.

 - SSG: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
 - Theme: tweaked [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
 - Color scheme: [Rust language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
 - Cover art: [Japanese prints from the MET website](https://www.metmuseum.org)
