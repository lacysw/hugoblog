Hello, and welcome! You are currently reading my first "official" post here, having now fleshed out all of the necessary features of my new website, *swlacy.com*. This space is designed to fulfill my needs as a platform to publish technical content and reflect on my learning as a cybersecurity and political science student.

<!--truncate-->

There is not any particular wealth of content as I write this blog submission; most notably, you may find more information about me [here](/about-me) or view my first tutorial/walkthrough publication on HackTheBox's Previse challenge [here](/docs/reports/previse), but that highlights the extent of my uploads so far.

I have been hard at work tuning this website and maintaining the WWU Cybersecurity Club over the 2021 holiday season; expect more articles and blog posts to appear soon enough.

Kind regards,  
Sid Lacy
